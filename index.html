    <ul>
      <li>APTA member since 2024</li>
      <li>[Insert link to professional behaviors doc]</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Benedictine Values</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Service - I have been able to be a role model for upcoming high school athletes in the area that have dreams of pursuing a college career in athletics. As a student, I am prepared to take these attributes with me into my first clinical.</li>
      <li>Hospitality - By being hospitable to my peers, this has helped me develop a deeper understanding of how they think for me to understand them better. In the clinic, I can take these hospitality skills with me to best serve the patients.</li>
      <li>Moderation - PT school has really tested my moderation skills by me being able to time manage and still find time for leisure. This in turn has allowed me to perform better in school and better help my patients.</li>
      <li>Prayer - Prayer is something I have utilized to slow down my busy life and take a step back and give thanks for the opportunity to be busy doing something I enjoy.</li>
      <li>Respect for Persons - in my first clinical, respect for persons is what will gain a sense of trust and comfort between myself and my patients. I have grown in a way to put myself in others' shoes to have a deeper understanding of them.</li>
      <li>Community - being active in my community has not only benefited others, but myself as well. I gain a sense of accomplishment giving back to the community, which I am able to carry into my student life to succeed in the classroom and on my first clinical.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Volunteer Hours</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>UMary track and field clinics: coached young elementary, junior high, and high school athletes with long jump and triple jump camps. These camps were done in a fun environment that contributed to engagement and athletic encouragement in the jumping events - 20 hours. </li>
      <li>Fort Lincoln State Park: assisted with cleaning the park area and putting wire up around trees to preserve them from wildlife - 2 hours.</li>
      <li>Bismarck Legacy High School track and field: coached high school athletes through long jump drills - 1 hour.</li>
      <li>High School track and field event worker: ran the triple jump event at a Bismarck meet - 2 hours</li>
